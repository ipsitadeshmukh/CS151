Report on HWTo check whether the withdrawals and deposits work properly, I created a bank account with zero balance. I made a deposit runnable that would deposit $1 10 times and a withdrawable that would withdraw 1 10 times. We can say the bank account is corrupted if the final balance is different from the initial balance. We say this as the total amount of withdrawal is same as the total deposit amount.1. With the withdrawal and deposits to unsynchronized methods, the balance does not remain zero after all deposits and withdrawals are over.    This shows that something is going wrong when the threads run. The screenshots provided show the different final balance.2. With SynchronisedBankAccount, we see that after the method runs, the end balance is zero.    This is the correct balance. The screenshot provided shows this   When using SynchronisedBankAccount instead of the regular bank account, we are able to prevent this corruption.
